# AbstractAPR
This repository holds the code produced during the writing of the Master's Thesis "Repairing math-related bugs in circuit-based quantum programs through abstract interpretation". It holds both the APR solution proposed in the thesis, as well as the gathered dataset utilized to evaluate the tool. The presented results can be reproduced by executing the datasetTester.py script in the abstractAPR directory, taking the desired buggy and fixed sets as input. Note that results are always not 100% reproducible, as the core patch generation scheme adopted utilizes a random search algorithm, thus slightly affecting repair results, time and cost.
